## Overview of the Code
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame. The game provides an interactive environment where the player controls a growing snake that moves across the screen, eats food, and avoids collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features
✅ Smooth Gameplay – The snake moves seamlessly in all four directions.<br>
✅ Score Tracking – Displays the current and best score.<br>
✅ Game Over Screen – Provides options to retry or exit when the snake collides.<br>
✅ Dynamic Food Placement – The food appears at random positions after being eaten.<br>
✅ Grid-Based Movement – The snake moves in fixed blocks for better control.<br>
✅ Border Collision Detection – Ends the game when the snake hits the boundaries.<br>
