### 1- Game Cows Bulls : 
This code implements a guessing game called "Bulls and Cows," where the player must guess a 4-digit number. For each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of "Bulls" and "Cows"; "Bulls" represent digits that are correct in both position and value, while "Cows" indicate digits that are in the secret number but in the wrong position. The generated number has no repeated digits and falls between 1000 and 9999. The player continues to guess until they either identify the correct number or run out of attempts. If the player successfully guesses the number, a success message is displayed; otherwise, the hidden number is revealed.
