### 1- Game Cows Bulls : 
This code implements a guessing game called "Bulls and Cows," where the player must guess a 4-digit number. For each guess, the program provides feedback in the form of "Bulls" and "Cows"; "Bulls" represent digits that are correct in both position and value, while "Cows" indicate digits that are in the secret number but in the wrong position. The generated number has no repeated digits and falls between 1000 and 9999. The player continues to guess until they either identify the correct number or run out of attempts. If the player successfully guesses the number, a success message is displayed; otherwise, the hidden number is revealed.

### 2- Tic Tac Toe :
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a simple and popular game usually played between two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player chooses the X symbol, and the other chooses O. The objective of the game is to place three of one's own symbols in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
The first player starts by placing their symbol in one of the grid cells. Then it is the second player's turn. This process continues until one player gets three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, winning the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
There are specific strategies to win. Placing a symbol in the center of the grid increases the chances of winning. Additionally, if an opponent is close to winning, it's essential to block their move by placing a symbol in the right cell. This game's simplicity and lack of special equipment make it appealing to people of all ages.
